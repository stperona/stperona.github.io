                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>Hello! I'm Stephen Perona, freelance animator and 3D modeler, currently
                    living in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Since first being introduced to
                    3D modeling in 2002, I have worked tirelessly to teach myself the
                    ins-and-outs of the craft, initially utilizing Autodesk's 3D Studio Max
                    software. Being predominately self-taught, I relied on online communities
                    to grow my experience and gain exposure. I've participated in community
                    projects as well as several online competitions, twice resulting in
                    features in "3D Creative" magazine.</p>
                    <p>In 2006, I began using Autodesk's Maya and directed my focus towards
                    learning character animation. In 2008, I participated in the Mass Animation
                    project, a crowd sourced animation project presented on Facebook. In the
                    end, four of my submitted shots were selected for inclusion in the final
                    short film entitled "Live Music". The film made the rounds at film
                    festivals, and was released on iTunes and theatrically as the opener to
                    "Planet 51" at select locations.<br>
                    <br>
                    In addition to working as a freelance animator and 3D modeler, I recently
                    graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelors of Science in
                    Computer Science and do some work as a software/web programmer.<br>
                    <br>

                    critiques, or job opportunities!</p>
