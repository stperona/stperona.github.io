        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Stephen Perona, freelance animator and 3D modeler, currently
        living in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Since first being introduced to
        3D modeling in 2002, I have worked tirelessly to teach myself the
        ins-and-outs of the craft, initially utilizing Autodesk's 3D Studio Max
        software. Being predominately self-taught, I relied on online communities
        to grow my experience and gain exposure. I've participated in community
        projects as well as several online competitions, twice resulting in
        features in "3D Creative" magazine.</p>
        <p>In 2006, I began using Autodesk's Maya and directed my focus towards
        learning character animation. In 2008, I participated in the Mass Animation
        project, a crowd sourced animation project presented on Facebook. In the
        end, four of my submitted shots were selected for inclusion in the final
        short film entitled "Live Music". The film made the rounds at film
        festivals, and was released on iTunes and theatrically as the opener to
        "Planet 51" at select locations.<br>
        <br>
        In addition to working as a freelance animator and 3D modeler, I recently
        graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelors of Science in
        Computer Science and do some work as a software/web programmer.<br>
        <br>
